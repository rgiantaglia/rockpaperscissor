# rockpaperscissor
This is my basic version of a Rock Paper Scissor game. 

This game was especially helpful to teach me to call a function inside another function and to understand how to return a value. 
Moreover, I also learned how to call a function multiple times.

This game needs more work, but in the meantime it was a good and helpful learning process.
